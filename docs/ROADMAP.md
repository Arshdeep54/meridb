# MeriDB Development Roadmap

## Current Status
MeriDB currently has a basic storage engine implementation with the following components:
- Table management
- Page-based storage
- Record operations (CRUD)
- Basic data types
- Column definitions

## Next Steps

### 1. Query Processing Layer
- [ ] SQL Parser
  - Implement a parser for basic SQL statements (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
  - Handle WHERE clauses
  - Support basic expressions and operators
  - Add support for CREATE TABLE and DROP TABLE

- [ ] Query Planner
  - Develop a basic query optimization strategy
  - Implement query plan generation
  - Add support for simple join operations
  - Cost-based optimization for query plans

- [ ] Query Executor
  - Sequential scan implementation
  - Index scan implementation
  - Join execution algorithms (nested loop, hash join)
  - Aggregation operations (GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, etc.)

### 2. Index Management
- [ ] B-Tree Index Implementation
  - Basic B-Tree structure
  - Insert operations
  - Delete operations
  - Range scan support
  - Index maintenance during updates

- [ ] Index Selection
  - Automatic index selection based on queries
  - Index statistics maintenance
  - Multi-column index support

### 3. Transaction Management
- [ ] ACID Properties Implementation
  - Atomicity through write-ahead logging (WAL)
  - Consistency through constraints
  - Isolation using MVCC (Multiversion Concurrency Control)
  - Durability through proper disk syncing

- [ ] Concurrency Control
  - Implementation of lock manager
  - Deadlock detection and prevention
  - Transaction isolation levels
  - Two-phase locking protocol

### 4. Recovery System
- [ ] Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)
  - Log record format design
  - Log buffer management
  - Checkpoint mechanism
  - Recovery protocol implementation

- [ ] Backup and Restore
  - Online backup capability
  - Point-in-time recovery
  - Log archiving
  - Restore verification

### 5. Buffer Management
- [ ] Buffer Pool Implementation
  - Page replacement policy (LRU)
  - Dirty page management
  - Buffer pool size configuration
  - Pre-fetching strategies

### 6. Query Optimization
- [ ] Statistics Collection
  - Table statistics
  - Column value distribution
  - Index statistics
  - Query performance metrics

- [ ] Cost Model
  - I/O cost estimation
  - CPU cost estimation
  - Memory usage estimation
  - Network cost for distributed queries

### 7. Client Interface
- [ ] Client Protocol
  - Wire protocol definition
  - Connection handling
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Query results streaming

- [ ] Client Libraries
  - Native Rust client
  - Language-specific drivers (Python, Java, etc.)
  - Connection pooling
  - Prepared statements

### 8. Administration Tools
- [ ] Monitoring
  - Performance metrics collection
  - Query analysis tools
  - Resource usage monitoring
  - Alert system

- [ ] Management
  - Configuration management
  - User management
  - Backup scheduling
  - Log rotation and management

## Implementation Priority

1. Query Processing Layer
   - This is the most immediate need to make the database functional
   - Start with basic SELECT and INSERT operations
   - Gradually add more complex query support

2. Index Management
   - Essential for performance optimization
   - Start with basic B-Tree implementation
   - Add support for different index types later

3. Transaction Management
   - Critical for data consistency
   - Begin with basic ACID compliance
   - Add more sophisticated features later

4. Buffer Management
   - Important for performance
   - Implement basic page replacement
   - Optimize based on usage patterns

5. Recovery System
   - Essential for durability
   - Start with basic WAL
   - Add more recovery features over time

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Keep components loosely coupled
- Use trait-based interfaces for flexibility
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage
- Document all public APIs

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interaction
- Performance benchmarks
- Stress testing for concurrent operations

### Performance Considerations
- Monitor memory usage
- Optimize disk I/O
- Profile critical code paths
- Benchmark against similar databases

### Documentation
- Maintain detailed API documentation
- Create user guides
- Document design decisions
- Keep implementation notes

## Contributing
- Follow Rust best practices
- Write comprehensive tests
- Document changes thoroughly
- Review code for security implications
